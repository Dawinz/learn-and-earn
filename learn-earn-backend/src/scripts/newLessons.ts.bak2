### Profile Optimization

**Complete ALL Profile Sections:**

Every survey platform asks demographic questions. Complete these thoroughly:
- Age, gender, location, education
- Employment status and industry
- Household income and size
- Interests and hobbies
- Technology ownership
- Health and wellness topics
- Shopping habits
- Travel frequency

**Why It Matters:**
- Better survey matching = fewer disqualifications

- Priority invitations for your demographics
- 30-50% more survey invitations

### Disqualification Strategies

**Minimize Disqualifications:**

1. **Answer Consistently**:
   - Keep notes on your answers
   - Use same employment/income responses
   - Don't contradict previous surveys

2. **Watch for Trap Questions**:
   - "Select option 3 to show you're paying attention"
   - Duplicate questions checking consistency
   - Impossible answer combinations

3. **Target Your Demographics**:
   - If you're frequently disqualified, your profile doesn't match
   - Consider which platforms fit your demographics
   - Some platforms work better for certain groups

4. **Don't Rush**:
   - Speeding through gets you flagged
   - Read questions carefully
   - Take at least 1 second per question

### Referral Income

**Build Passive Income:**

Most platforms offer referral bonuses:
- **Swagbucks**: 10% of referral earnings (lifetime)
- **InboxDollars**: $1 per referral + 30% of their earnings
